# PunyInform

PunyInform is a library written in Inform 6 which allows people to create text adventure games / interactive fiction using the Z-machine virtual machine, to be played on 8-bit computers as well as newer platforms. It provides a parser, implementations of common verbs, as well as a framework for writing text adventures.

PunyInform is based on the Inform 6 library, developed by Graham Nelson. We are trying to make it easy for authors used to writing in Inform 6 to start using PunyInform. There is a manual describing the differences.

Games using PunyInform can be compiled to z3, z5 and z8 format. Compared to the Inform 6 library, this means we lack support for Glulx, but we have support for z3 (which the Inform 6 library lacks).

To compile games using PunyInform, we recommend the official Inform 6 compiler maintained by David Kinder, at https://github.com/DavidKinder/Inform6 . Binaries can be found at [if-archive](http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXcompilersXinform6Xexecutables.html) . PunyInform requires Inform v6.34 or newer.

## Motivation

The main goal of PunyInform is to allow for games which are fast and have a small memory footprint. This should make the games run well on older architectures, such as the 8-bit computers of the 1980s. Our main target is to make it suitable for games on the Commodore 64 using [Ozmoo](https://github.com/johanberntsson/ozmoo/).


## Status

We consider PunyInform ready for real-world use. Please check releasenotes.txt for more details on the latest version, what bugs have been fixed, what features have been added etc.

## Articles

Fredrik Ramsberg has written a few articles describing PunyInform for beginners:

* [PunyInform, a new library for writing text adventures for old computers](https://vintageisthenewold.com/punyinform-a-new-library-for-writing-text-adventures-for-old-computers/) gives a general overview and introduction.

* [PunyInform: Installing the tools and compiling a game](https://vintageisthenewold.com/punyinform-installing-the-tools-and-compiling-a-game/) goes more into detail on how to setup an environment with PunyInform and the inform compiler on Windows, and getting started on a simple game.

* [PunyInform Coding 1: The Basics](https://vintageisthenewold.com/punyinform-coding-1-the-basics/) covers the fundamentals of developing a game using PunyInform.
