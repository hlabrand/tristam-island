These are brainstorming files, i.e. me thinking and typing at fast as I can to get through some ideas

Therefore:
  - it's both in English and in French and the same time
  - there is profanity
  - there can be sentences that sound rough/unkind when my intent is just to be quick ("this is shit" = "i don't like it and won't spend more time on it")
  
You're warned!
