! Lower island

Immaculate beach
  This is the south side of the island you are now stuck on. The immensity of the Atlantic Ocean makes you feel minuscule, a needle in a haystack, with no chance of being rescued. A steep hill covered by a dense forest stands to the north; climbing it would likely take hours, and you don't really know what you could find there, but you might as well explore your new home. The beach extends to the northeast, where you can see a large boulder, and to the west.

! Exploration
> x beach / sand / sandy beach
The beach angles slightly downhill towards the sea. It is made of yellow, compact sand; the high tide probably submerges the beach every time.
TODO: angles downhill, really???

> x forest / trees
A dense forest covers the south side of the island; you have to go through it if you want to climb up the hill and see the rest of the island.
TODO: but should it really be covered in a dense forest? cause it slopes? UUUGH I hate this

> x hill / island / mountain
The island you ended up on appears to be a tall chunk of rock that seems to form a plateau at the top. Cliffs surround the island, except on the south side, which has a more gentle slope and is covered by a dense forest.
TODO: tall chunk of rock? uuuugh i hate this

You decide to go take a closer look at the boulder, and head northeast.

End of the beach
  You reached what seems to be the end of the beach; behind a large boulder, it seems to taper off quickly, and the coast turns into steep rocks and shallow tidal pools. A small cove is to the north; the rest of the beach extends southwest.
  
> x boulder / x rock / x ball / x formation
A large rock formation, not quite detached from the rest of the island, marks the end of the beach. Behind it, the eastern shore of the island mostly consists in jagged rocks and shallow tidal pools.

Sandy beach by the forest
  The small beach is angled down, with very small waves crashing periodically on the shore. You can clearly see the high tide line, delineated by small shrubs that grow very close to the sand. Behind these, to the north, is a clearing leading into the forest. The sandy beach extends eastward; to the west, below tall cliffs, it becomes smaller and rockier.

Waist-deep in the ocean
  You trudge uncomfortably into the cold water, and try to look around you. The horizon is bare, and there aren't any fish, or anything floating at the surface. The island looms behind you.

You squint and try to find something, anything, on the horizon. After a few minutes, you give up.

From the ocean, you can appreciate the size of the island: rather large, and tall, but you probably only need a couple of days to explore it. You are off shore from a beach near a clearing, north of you.

Knee-deep in the ocean
  A submerged sandbank extending southwest makes it so you can walk further into the ocean without getting too wet. Behind you, you can see the cliffs of the southwestern tip of the island.

> x cliffs / x chalk / x tall / x white
These tall white cliffs appear to be made of chalk; you guess they are probably fifty feet tall. At the top of the cliffs, dense trees are growing -- although you think you can spot something behind them. It looks like a tall, metallic mast, although it's unlikely to be that on a deserted island.

You are at the bottom of tall and almost vertical cliffs, standing on a small flat stretch of sand and rocks that you can barely call a beach. East of you is a sandy beach; to the northwest, you can see a small strait.

Northern cliffs
  A tall cliff made of chalk runs along the northern edge of the island; down below, where you are standing, is a small beach littered with rocks and pebbles. You're surprised to see a small fishing boat, moored to a long wooden pier; this is the first trace of human life you have spotted on this island! There is also a rickety-looking platform on the beach, right against the side of the cliff; it looks like it can rise all the way up to the top of the cliff with a rope and pulley mechanism.

> x pier / dock / pontoon / wooden
There is a wooden pier here, about twenty feet long; the wood looks old and wet, but it is still in very good shape. A small fishing boat is moored here.

> x boat / x fishing / x rowboat / x compartment / x drawer / x trunk / x case
A small fishing boat is moored here; it looks sturdy, but it's not very usable, as its oars are missing. A wide compartment made of wood is at the stern of the boat; it is closed.

> find oar
Unfortunately, the oars of the boat could be anywhere; the tide probably took them.

> enter boat / climb in boat
Without oars, that boat isn't very useful.

> open boat
You run your fingers around the compartment, and manage to find a way to pop it open. Inside, you find a fishing rod, a bowie knife, and a fishing net.

> take all
You can only carry 2 items.

> take fishing rod
Taken.
> x it
Surprisingly, this fishing rod looks in rather good condition, including its reel, which still turns rather well. It is about two to three feet long; the hook and the line are on there too, which is good, as you're not sure you would have known how to attach them there.

> x reel / x line / x hook -> fishing rod
> take/remove reel/line/hook
This is attached to the fishing rod, and you don't particularly want to remove them from there -- you're not sure you'd know how to put it back together.

> take fishing net / made of rope / hemp / x weights / x floats
Taken.
> x it
This fishing net is very long, of a rectangular shape, with floats on one side and weights on the other; you doubt you could use it by yourself. You're guessing it is meant to be held vertically in the sea by at least two people. However, you might be able to find another use for it; the rope it's made of is strong, and there are very few holes in it that would compromise its structural integrity.

> x seaweed
Some seaweed has grown under the boat's hull, which hasn't been scraped for years.

> take seaweed
Taken.

> eat seaweed / eat algae / (dry seaweed?)
You've heard before that seaweed is full of vitamins. You don't really want to eat it sopping wet, so you spread it on the wooden pier, letting the sun dry it. You wait quite a while, contemplating the horizon and your surroundings, until the seaweed is much more edible. You eat it; it tastes salty, its texture reminds you of overcooked spaghetti, and your stomach is so happy you moan in contentment.
[Your score has increased by 1? point.]

> x elevator / platform / mechanism / ropes / pulley / pulleys / elevated
Your eyes follow the very long rope running alongside the cliff. It runs from the beach, up to a pulley mechanism that is installed at the top of the cliff, then back down, where it is tied to a sort of arch, a metal handle attached to both sides of a rudimentary platform on the beach. This bucket-like platform looks looks large enough to carry a fisherman, or its large haul of fish, all the way up the cliff.

> cut rope with knife / untie rope
You might be able to recover the rope this way, but it would be smarter to leave it like that and use it to climb up the cliffs.

> climb rope
You could attempt to climb the rope if all else fails, but that platform looks like it could take you to the top of the cliff.

> pull rope
You pull on the rope and, with some effort, manage to raise the platform by a few feet. You don't see the point of going any higher; you carefully let the rope go until the platform is once again on the ground.

> get in elevator / get on platform
You enter the platform, minding your head.

> pull rope
You start pulling on the rope, and the platform slowly ascends; it takes a lot of effort to pull your own weight up. You start feeling weak after a few feet, and you decide to slowly, carefully, let the rope go, instead of going for broke and risking plumetting to your death. You should try this again when you feel more rested and have more energy - eating a good meal would be a good start.

(si t'as déjà mangé le poisson : You should try this again when you feel more rested.)

Cove
This small cove is made of a steep beach made of wet sand; the waves are a little more turbulent here, but it's still a nice place to stop at for a moment. The part of the island that stands behind you is a steep hill covered in trees, curving up to what seems to be a plateau; this is probably not a good approach for the climb. From here, you can follow the coast by walking in shallow waters, towards the northwest or the south.

Edge of the woods
The woods begin here, in this small clearing; the trees, dense and bearing flowers of strikingly vibrant colors, give you a nice respite from the sun beating down on your head. The floor of the forest is rather dense undergrowth, which you imagine teeming with life; you're pretty sure you can see something moving under the large mossy rock here. You can go deeper in the forest by going north, or back to the beach by going to the south.

The hill gets very steep, and you doubt you could climb it; the wet grass and patches of mud would certainly make you slip onto these sharp white stones that you can see, almost perfectly spaced, all the way up to the hill.

You contemplate one of the white stones poking out of the mud, and suddenly its shape, an almost perfect pyramid, seems unnatural, almost too sharp. Almost... carved?

You clear off some of the mud near one of the white rocks, revealing that the rock has indeed been carved in straight lines, in a rectangular shape. You sigh contemplating the size of the task at hand; you're much too tired (if didn't eat yet: and weak) to undertake such a task right now.

A shadow passes over you. You look up, and see a huge, white albatross descending towards you. The bird is magnificent, and its enormous wingspan makes it look bigger than you; you recoil a little bit, and instinctively protect your fish. The albatross lands near you, and looks at you intently.

A magnificent beast, a huge white bird with a wingspan so big you can't help but feel threatened by it. But so far, it seems pretty staid, respectful even; pushy, but polite. It knows that you know what it wants, and will wait until you're ready to give it up.

You kneel to carefully drop your fishing rod. The albatross perks up; you look at your rod for just one second, and it swoops in and snatches the fish out of your hand.

The albatross takes flight and disappears somewhere, behind some rocks. You sigh; you're going to have to try to fish again.

But suddenly, the albatross comes back, and lands softly near you. In its beak, there is some kind of stick, that he drops on the floor, at your feet. You pick it up. You could swear you saw the albatross nod at you before taking flight again -- this time for good.

After a few seconds, you see the albatross approaching, and it flies above you in circles, surveying the situation. It then lands near you, and looks at you straight in the eye. Its glare is confused, maybe even angry; it tilts his head to the side, seemingly wondering why you called for help and what it is that you're expecting. It finally lets out a frustrated squawk and flies away.

You very cautiously start the fire, and spend several minutes making sure it catches, stoking the flames and setting bigger and bigger sticks alight. After a while, you have a good fire going; you find a long branch and use it to cook the fish above the flame. The process takes a while, and your stomach gurgles, but when you finally cut the fish and start eating it, it tastes like the best fish you have ever had.

You reckon you have time, and you don't have to finish today; so you sit down and start clearing the dirt off the steps. There's a few inches of soft mud covering the small steps, but some patience, and your sturdy fishing knife to carve out some of the mud, you manage to clear enough mud to step on the next step. You carve yourself a path on the steps, uncovering them one by one after all these years. On the morning of the second day, you finally reach the top; you let out a victory shout, rub your hands on your trousers to get some of the mud off, and finally climb the last step.

! Dans tous les cas
The top of the hill is rather flat, forming a vast plateau. You look around you, and your heart fills with joy. Incredibly, there are a dozen buildings here, of various sizes, the tallest one being the radio tower at the southwest, and the most imposing one being the tall, white house looming in the backdrop, to the east. It all seems surreal, but there it is: the island was inhabited by several dozen people, at some point. Now, everyone seems to have gone, but there is probably a lot of things lying around that could be useful -- not to mention, the radio might still be in working condition, and you might be able to figure out how to use it to call for help. Your chances of survival have drastically gone up!

Incredibly, there are a dozen buildings here, of various sizes and all fairly recent-looking, the tallest one being the radio tower at the southwest, and the most imposing one being the tall, white house looming in the backdrop, to the east. Building that kind of community ex nihilo must have been quite the undertaking. Who would build this in the middle of the ocean? And why?

Houses by the town centre
A few houses are arranged in a row that forms a path going north, to a sort of plaza at the center of the village, and south, to the edge of the plateau. The houses look similar, except the door to one of them looks different from the others -- much cruder, as if it had been replaced. You can cut accross the grass to the west, to another house, or to the east, towards a fence.

Those small one-storey houses aren't much to look at; they are made of concrete and their roof is made of the corrugated tin you see everywhere else in the island. One of them stands out, as its door seems to have been replaced by a much cruder wooden door, and its hinges are on the exterior of the house. You wonder if that door was made on the island.

> x crude wooden door / hinges outside / exterior hinges
This door looks rather unique, as if it had been hacked together using only the resources of the island; the other doors look like standard doors that must have been made in a factory and imported here. Interestingly, the hinges are positioned on the exterior of the house here.

These doors are quite sturdy -- even the crude wooden door, which doesn't budge.

Center of the village
This area looks like the center of the village, with paths going many directions from the small fountain at the middle. Some buildings are at the north, closer to the edge of the cliff, and south, forming a path that runs to the edge of the plateau overlooking the forest. You can also go east to an imposing fence around the white house, or west to the island's pub. Finally, you spot some diesel generators to the northeast, between the houses and the fence.

Amazingly, it still works, and the water that falls in the tub is very clear. Tasting it reveals it's freshwater, which is a big relief; you may not have to collect rainwater to survive here after all.
You drink some of the water from the pump and instantly feel refreshed.

Outside the pub
The building in front of you has a sign displaying ~SHIP AND ANCHOR~ -- a great name for a pub on this island, really. From the outside, it doesn't really look like your classic English pub: no thatched roof here, just the same greenish corrugated tin roof you see everywhere on this island. But the building doesn't look in bad shape. Behind it, to the west, is a small garden; paths lead northwest and southwest to other buildings, or east to go back to the fountain.

This is the pub of the island, the ~Ship and Anchor~. This means the people who lived here were British; after all, wherever there's Brits near the sea, there's a pub named ~Ship and Anchor~.

Overgrown garden
This seems to have been, a long time ago, some sort of vegetable patch. About a dozen shallow trenches have been dug here; they are now covered in weeds and tall grass. You're guessing the people living here were trying to grow a few vegetables, to supplement a diet that mostly consisted of fish from the sea and canned food from the island's storehouse, which you can see to the north. You are behind the island's pub, which is east of you; there is also a house to the south.

The trenches that were dug by the inhabitants of the island have been invaded by weeds and grass; the outline of the vegetable patch is only vaguely discernible under the thick vegetation.

You take a look at the trenches, hoping to find something interesting{, but there doesn't seem to be anything|. After a few minutes, you spot a coin; it's a sixpence, that you pick up.}

> burn brambles: would achieve nothing

> cut vegetation / clear vegetation / remove vegetation
You probably will want to clear that patch and try to revive it if you have to stay here for months, or years. But you haven't resigned yourself to that fate yet; let's first explore options to escape the island sooner than later.

Outside the storehouse
You are near the edge of the cliff. There is a platform here, hanging via a rope-and-pulley mechanism above a beach; this was probably used for fishing. The building here is larger than most other ones in the village, and doesn't have any windows; it looks like the island's storehouse. Its door was left open, and you can see there still are a few things inside on its shelves. South is an overgrown garden, and southeast is the island's pub. You can also go east to a house by the cliffs.

You are following a wide path along the northern cliff of the island; west is the island's storehouse and the elevated platform, and east is a small shop, while going south, behind the house, leads to the island's pub. There is a small house here; the door (might be unlocked)(is unlocked).

Small shop
This is a small shop, with a wide window allowing you to peek inside the shop. The window has been painted with a crude logo, displaying ~Harry's Earthly Pleasures~. Judging by what you see through the window, that shop has wares that were probably imported from the land -- hence the play on words. The cliffs advance to form a small tip to the north of here; you can also go east, towards a woodshop, or west, towards a small house.

Scenic view
Atop the cliffs is a small grassy area that looks rather pleasant. From here, the immensity of the ocean is on full display, and it feels like a nice area for a rest. Apparently, you're not the only one to have had this idea: a few logs have been placed here, in a circle, and you can see the remnants of a fire in the center of the circle. Looks like this was a popular picnic area. You can go back towards the small shop to the south.

> x shop
(found_in) You decide to take a closer look at the small shop.

> x fire / logs / wood / chunks / burnt/spent
No fire has been lit here for a very long time. A few large rocks are arranged in a circle, and a few chunks of wood are in the middle. Next to the fire, there is an empty can of Spam.

> x spam can
A can of Spam, that canned spiced ham that really doesn't taste very good. A wartime delicacy, as Thatcher famously said -- the British army sure ate their share during the war. But you're guessing that if you're on an island in the middle of nowhere, trying to feed dozens of people for months on end, you don't have many options, and you have to resort to it. The menu here probably resembled the one in that Monty Python sketch -- maybe there were fewer Vikings around, though.

Woodshop
From what you can see inside the large window at the front of the building, this is some kind of woodshop. Presumably, someone here was in charge of making or fixing all sorts of furniture and wooden objects for the whole island; you can see a sturdy-looking table in the middle of the workshop. Another shop is next to this one, to the east; behind the woodshop, you can see diesel generators, to the south.

Power generators of the island
A dirt path leads to an small area off to the side, behind some shrubs and close to the fence closing off the white house. Here, three green machines stand tall; it looks like they used to be the island's main power source. The power generators are all connected to a central tank, which would get filled, presumably with diesel, to keep the lights on -- and, presumably, the radio tower. Restarting them would give you a good chance of being able to call for help. To the north, near the cliffs, is the island's woodshop; you can follow the fence towards the main door to the south, or go to the center of the village, southwest of you.

> x diesel generators / x crank / x flywheel / x sticker / x green lister diesel generators
Three imposing, green diesel generators made of metal are here; the sticker, which is almost peeled off, says ~Lister Diesel Power Generator - 12 hp~. {The generators seem to have been modified to all get their fuel from a central tank, also painted green.} {They have seen better days: the paint on the flywheel is chipped, and the crank shows some corrosion.} Hopefully you can get them to run for a few hours, so you can {%power the radio on and send a call for help|open the mansion's door and, hopefully, find a way to send a distress radio signal}.

> x crank
The crank is connected to a heavy flywheel. You don't know too much about generators, but it looks like turning the crank starts the flywheel, which starts the whole generator and the fuel injection system. {They have seen better days: the paint on the flywheel is chipped, and the crank shows some corrosion.}

> x tank / x fuel tank
{The generators seem to have been modified to all get their fuel from a central tank, also painted green.} The tank is very large, and can probably store enough fuel for days. The problem is, you have no idea where to find any diesel, if there is even any left on the island. You might need to get creative.

> listen
You hear nothing unexpected; the generators are off.

> switch/turn generators on / turn-push-pull crank
The wheels are very heavy, and it's quite the effort to start turning the crank. You turn it for a few rotations, but nothing happens; even after you flip the small lever on the generator, which in theory should start injecting the fuel, still nothing.

> open tank
The lid on top of the tank is heavy, but you manage to push it to the side enough to see what's inside. The tank is empty.

> x fence
The chainlink fence surrounds a field in which a tall white mansion is. This, of course, makes you want to enter it and find out what is so important in it that it needed to be protected from everyone else on this island. But the fence is close to ten feet tall, and topped with barbed wire.

> x bushes / x shrub / x bush / x shrubs
Around the generators, and close to the fence, there are a few bushes and shrubs. They are quite dense, {and you can't really see at a first glance if there is anything hiding under or behind them}{but you were able to spot a hole in the fence behind them}.

> x bushes again / look under/behind bushes / search bushes
You decide to take a closer look at the bushes and search them. They are quite dense, and rather prickly, so you proceed with caution; but eventually, you manage to spot a hole in the fence, near the ground.

> x hole/opening
There is a hole in the fence here, near the ground and big enough for someone to crawl through. You doubt the hole was made by an animal; someone probably made the hole so they could enter the white house without being seen. Interesting!

(on rajoute la mention du trou) The chainlink fence surrounds a field in which a tall white mansion is. This, of course, makes you want to enter it and find out what is so important in it that it needed to be protected from everyone else on this island.

Door in the fence
You are standing by an open field, behind a fence, west of a white mansion with a closed front door. The fence is tall, and there is barbed wire at the top; the door here allowed people to go in and out, but the guardhouse shows it was closely monitored. A sign by the guardhouse right behind the fence reads ~Authorised Personnel Only~. The door is locked. You can follow the fence by going north or southeast, or go to the center of the village by going west; a dirt path to the southwest leads to a few houses near the edge of the village.

> x white house / x mansion
The white mansion is two stories tall and is made of wooden boards painted in white. The front door is not boarded, but the windows are. The fact that this house is behind a tall fence with access closely monitored entrance {makes you want to enter it and find out what is so important in it that it needed to be protected from everyone else on this island}.

Around the fence
You are roughly to the south of the tall white mansion, but on the other side of the chainlink fence with barbed wire at the top. {This is the edge of the plateau, where the forest starts; the trees are rather tall, and their branches grow above the fence.} You're guessing they didn't use to be so tall when the island was inhabited. You can go to the door in the fence to the northwest, or follow the edge of the plateau towards a few houses to the south.

! Opening the fence
! Solution 1:
> climb tree
You look up, and there is indeed one large branch that grows above the fence. It's a bit dangerous, but it'll work... You start climbing the tree, slowly and carefully, then sit astride the branch. Your heart is beating fast, and you try your best not to look down as you steadily progress along the branch, which bends under your weight. You keep going -- but the branch is getting too thin to support your weight, and start cracking and tipping! You lose your grip, and land on your back in a mighty crash. Your back is sore, but you don't seem to have broken anything. After a few minutes, you sit up with some difficulty... and find yourself inside the fenced area! It's good you landed on the right side of the fence...

! Solution 2:
> nw
> n
> cut bushes
(if knife in player) The branches of the bush are prickly and thick; you manage to cut one of them after a few minutes and a couple of cuts to your fingers. You decide to give up; there's got to be a better way.
> crawl in hole / go in hole / go through hole / kneel / crawl
The hole is very close to the dense bushes, and going through them isn't easy -- let alone try to kneel down. You cut your hands on the prickly branches, and even your temple when you try to crouch in the bush. In the end, the best way is to crawl backwards into the bushes, and fumble trying to find the hole in the fence: at least your shoes clear the way, and you don't get pricked as much. It's quite the ordeal, and you still manage to get cut a couple more times, but you finally manage to get to the other side, and into the fenced area.

Field
You are inside the fence, in a wide open field that's overgrown with rather tall grass. In the middle, the grass hasn't grown as much, suggesting this used to be a dirt path leading from the door in the fence and the guard's shack, which are west of you, to the front porch of the white house, which looms east of you.

> x guard shack

This means there was a guard employed full-time to monitor access, and occasionally point to the sign that says ~Authorised Personnel Only~. But what could be in that white house that was so important to be closed off to the rest of the people in the island?

> search guard shack / enter guard shack / look inside guard shack
You enter the small shack, hoping to find something useful, like a key, or a torch with its batteries still in it; but you find nothing useful.

> x grass / x field
This is a big field, about half the size of a football field; whoever built the fence obviously didn't want people to get anywhere close to the white house. Tall, green grass has grown everywhere here, after years without any human presence.

> search grass
You start walking through the grass while looking down attentively; maybe something useful was dropped here, years ago. You drag your feet on purpose, hoping to stumble upon something. This takes a long time, but you'd rather be thorough; and after ten minutes, you find a shilling, which only strengthens your resolve to walk the rest of the field. A few minutes later, your shoe hits a small, hard object. You get down on your knees and search the grass, and you end up finding a small key! The rest of your search is fruitless, but you're very happy you did it.

Front door of the white house
Two wide steps lead to a small porch, which makes the front door of the white house look even more imposing. This is a tall double door, and it's made of metal, whereas the house itself is made of wooden boards painted in white. Clearly, this is the entrance of a very private building; the rusty keypad to the right makes it clear that only those who know the secret code can enter.

The tall double door is made of metal, and looks reinforced. It has a handle, but no keyhole; and it is locked. It would be quite hard to go past this door without knowing the code.

This is a rather primitive keypad, with buttons arranged in two rows and displaying all numbers from 0 to 10, and an extra button to clear the code. The metal plate has rusted over the years, and so did one of the screws holding the plate. You're guessing that, like all keypads, it requires electricity to work and open the door remotely.

Storehouse - Front
The storehouse doesn't have any windows, so it's quite dark in here; but with the door open, you can see enough to notice that there are quite a few things left on the shelves. You can't really go further in the storehouse, as it is too dark, but you can go out through the door.

You step aside so the sun lights the shelves a bit better. There are a few tools, a little bit of hardware, and -- ah! A torch! You grab it, wondering if it still works, and if there's any batteries inside.

The torch opens, and there's a battery inside. You put it back together; it is much more useful this way.

You'll need more than the food on this shelf to survive, but what's on display here might still be very useful to you. The bag of coffee might still be good, but you're not sure about these teabags. The jam is probably bad, as well as the margarine; but those cans of beans are almost definitely still edible. You're not hungry right now, since you ate that fish not so long ago, but it's nice to know your menu choices have slightly expanded.

Storehouse - Back
The light of your torch shows a bit of a messier area, and you have to step over some boxes that were seemingly hastily discarded on the way out. The shelves here have a few cans of food -- mostly fish and SPAM -- and a couple of bottles of sauces. Further in the storehouse, there seems to be a dark room, which you enter by going through door frame; you can also go back out to the front of the storehouse.

(inform)A backpack is here, slouched against the wall by the door frame.

No way; this backpack is extremely useful to you.

> x food / x shelves / x cans / x kilner jars / x sauces / x bottles of worcestershire/marmite/sauce / x spam / x canned fish
These shelves haven't been completely emptied, as there are a few cans, jars and bottles left. The bottles are mostly sauce, namely worcestershire and marmite -- which confirms that the island was inhabited by British people. The cans are cans of SPAM spiced ham, with the iconic label; as for the jars, they look like regular canning jars, probably Kilner jars, and they contain a grey and silver mixture. Coming closer, you see there are labels: ~Grey mullet~, ~Bluefish~, and the appetizing-sounding ~Various~. This probably means the people living on the island fished extensively, and canned whatever fish they could spare in order to have some on hand at any time. This is very good news for you; the cans will last a while and save you some trouble.

A dozen clean, empty Kilner jars are resting on the counters; their lids are somewhere around there, too. These would presumably have been used to can more fish.

You don't really need any of this canning equipment right now. It's good to know it's there, but you might never end up needing it.

Small house
This is the last house of the village on this side of the island; it is rather small, compared to the other ones on the island, but looks exactly the same as the other buildings here. It is fairly close to the steel tower, which is southwest, and behind the pub, which is northeast. North is an overgrown garden, and east are a few more houses.

You try to open the door; much to your surprise, it wasn't locked before the occupants fled the island. You open it fully and enter the house.

Inside the pub landlord's house
This is a very small house, more like a cottage really. The posters on the wall give a clue about who lived in that house: given that they're all Guinness or Watneys posters, and given the aprons hanging on the hooks by the door, you're quite sure this is the pub landlord's house. There is no kitchen, just a living room and a small bathroom, and there are few pieces of furniture: a bed, a table and four chairs. You also spot a safe by the foot of the bed. The only way here is out.

You have never heard of Watneys, but you have definitely heard of, and drank, Guinness. These are vintage posters, with a graphic style that you associate with the 1940s or 1950s. The Watneys poster shows a golfing gentleman with the slogan ~What we want is Watney's Pale Ale~; the Guinness one is more fun, featuring a tucan balancing pints of Guinness on its beak, with the slogan ~Guinness is good for you~.

> x apron/aprons/jackets / x hook
Near the door are a row of hooks, with several white aprons and black jackets. You're guessing a pub landlord needs several of them, as they would get dirty quite frequently.

You close your eyes and smell the aprons. You smell a faint smell of beer and smoke, and you suddenly feel like you're in an old pub, with music and chatters around you. Or maybe it's just your imagination.

You pick a{n apron| jacket} from the hooks and wear it, then walk around with a grin on your face. ~{Last call! Last call, gentlemen!|All hail to the ale!|Hey you!

Pub
(if self hasnt light) The pub is mostly engulfed in darkness, although a little light is filtering through the windows. You can spot the bar and a few chairs, but that's about it.

The bar is, of course, opposite the door. You can't see it very well.

<Look>
Pub
The pub is rather large, with a dozen of different tables, and lots of chairs; a solitary pint is on a table. The bar is opposite of the door; the shelves behind it appear empty, as if all the alcohol had been taken. The door frame behind the bar leads to the pub's kitchen. On the south wall are hung a map, and a notice board with a signup sheet; there is a vintage-looking jukebox on the north wall.

> x pub / x north wall / x south wall
<Look>

> x jukebox
This small jukebox is strategically placed in the middle of the room, against a wall. A list of twenty songs is displayed at the top of the cabinet; the buttons next to each of them {are off}{glow invitingly}. The main window in the middle of the cabinet {is dark}{emits a bright yellow light, and displays the plate and record-changing mechanism}; a decal on the window identifies the machine as a BAL-AMi Junior. A note taped below the window, next to the coin receiver, reads ~One Song - 6p - 3 Songs - 1s~.

> turn on jukebox
There is no obvious button to do this; the problem seems to be that the whole island is currently without electricity.

> insert coin in jukebox
The only song a switched-off jukebox can play is ~4'33~ by John Cage, and you've already heard it before.{Inserting a coin into a jukebox that's turned off would be a waste of a coin.}

> x/read bulletin/notice/pin board/signup sheet/names/rows
The notice board hung to the wall is made of cork, and has a single sheet pinned to it. The title typed at the top reads ~COMMUNITY GARDEN SHIFTS~, and the rows below are for the month of february: Thursday the 1st, Friday the 2nd, Saturday the 3rd, etc. One or two people have signed up every day, until February 18th, at which point only one person signed up, then nobody else for the rest of the month. Strange.

    The map on the wall displays two islands. The largest one is called Kingsley Island; to the southwest is Tristam Island. You contemplate the geography for a few seconds, then it strikes you: the large island is the one you are on right now! No doubt about it: the plateau, the forest, the cliffs, the roughly circular shape... So now, you know that you are stuck on Kingsley Island. What's new to you{how about if they followed the sandbank?} is that there is an island to the southwest, named Tristam Island. You wonder what's on that island.

The bar is a bit dusty, after all these years. The shelves behind it, as well as under it, are completely empty; it looks like the inhabitants of the island thought it was necessary to bring all the alcohol with them.

> enter kitchen
Kitchen
The kitchen at the back of the pub is small but functional. The countertops are bare, and a bit stained; pots and pans are stored on shelves below. There are a few appliances here, such as a fridge, a stovetop, and a deep fryer. The only way is out, back to the pub.
 
> x formica counter / countertop
There isn't anything on the wooden countertop but a few circular stains -- probably from setting a hot pot or pan on the surface -- and a bit of dust. Under the countertop is where the pots and pans were stored.

> x pots / x pans
The pots and pans are stored under the wooden countertops of the kitchen. They look ancient (or, shall we say, they have a vintage design), and are made of stainless steel -- unless it's alluminium? You're not sure.
> take pots / pans
After thinking it over, you decide to take a pot -- the pans are too shallow to be useful for anything else than cooking, and it's not really time for you to make food yet.
> take pots / pans
Since you're the only one on this island, you're going to have to do all the dishes; the thought of dirtying another pot sounds awful to you.

> x fridge/refrigerator / x fridge door
This tall, old fridge is empty, and was left open for years. It is plugged in, but isn't making any noise; probably because there is no electricity on this island.
> listen to fridge
You hear nothing unexpected.
> put knife in fridge
You don't really need to refrigerate this.
(open/close container)

> x stovetop / burner(s)
The pub's electric stovetop has four big burners, and they really could have used a more thorough cleaning; there is brown grease and red stains between the burners.
> switch on stovetop
You try to push or turn the knobs, but nothing happens. Then you remember there still is no electricity on the island.

> x deep fryer / congealed/solid cooking oil / white fat
You're guessing this deep fryer was installed because any British pub has to have fish and chips on the menu. Whatever cooking oil was used has completely congealed, and now forms a huge block of white fat in the deep fryer.
> take it
You try to grab the cooking oil out of the deep fryer with your bare hands, but it's really stuck in there.
> cut it
With what?
> cut it with knife / carve oil with knife / extract oil with knife
You take your fishing knife and start cutting off a block of congealed oil. It takes a while, and your knife gets very messy, but eventually you manage to carve out a block that's about half of what was there.

> x block of oil
This is old cooking oil, that solidified after being left out here for who knows how long. It's roughly a cube of one foot by one foot by one foot. It's pretty slippery and greasy.
> slide oil / pour oil / slip on oil
The oil isn't hot enough to be liquid. Besides, may I remind you that you're lost at sea; this is no time to build a slip and slide.

Dropped. I guess it's not like you wanted to use it for cooking, so it's fine on the floor.

Inside Harry's shop
This is ~Harry's Earthly Pleasures~, a shop that has all sorts of goods that were probably imported from the land, for people here to buy with whatever disposable income they had. There's not much left on the shelves and the counter, but you see two packs of cigarettes{, a lighter}{, some binoculars}, some candy, a pack of gum, and a comic book. Some of this might be useful, but this is overall a bit disappointing. You can go out through the door.

You flip through the pages, and read distractedly. The heroes save the day at the end. You never really were into superheroes anyway.

The pot|bowl is now empty, though there is still a film of oil.

> turn on generators / turn crank
The wheels are very heavy, and it's quite the effort to start turning the crank. You turn it for a few rotations, and flip the small lever on the generator to start injecting the fuel. The generator starts shuddering, and lets out a thunderous sound. It works! After all these years, it still works! You can barely conceal your excitement: now you have a chance at calling for help and being rescued! Soon, the noise becomes more regular, although still noisy. You turn on a second generator in the same way, to make sure all the electrical devices on the island are brought back to life.

Power generators of the island
A dirt path leads to an small area off to the side, behind some shrubs and close to the fence closing off the white house. Here, three green machines stand tall; it looks like they used to be the island's main power source. You have filled the central tank with cooking oil -- call it biodiesel -- and now the generators are running and making a {low hum|loud noise} that indicates the power is on. You're hoping the generators will last until you find a way to call for help. To the north, near the cliffs, is the island's woodshop; you can follow the fence towards the main door to the south, or go to the center of the village, southwest of you.

A steel tower rises overhead, black against the sunny sky. This is an observation tower, {facing southeast, towards a small island you can barely distinguish on the horizon.} The top of the tower has what is quite clearly a radio antenna; you're not sure where the controls for the radio are. The ladder is missing a few rungs, which makes you unable to climb it -- for now.

You can climb a ladder to get to the top of the tower(if broken) -- as soon as you have fixed it, that is(end).

To the southeast, on the horizon, is a small island. (if posterinpub hasn't seen) You had no idea there was another island nearby!(else) This is probably Tristam Island, that you saw on the map inside the pub.

You would probably see it better atop the steel tower.

You look at (noun) through your binoculars. You can see its shore a bit better; the island seems to be low-lying, with a few bushes and brambles near its beach, but that's about all you can see. You would probably see it better atop the steel tower.

Top of the tower
The platform at the top of the tower is rather small. A low barrier runs around the platform, giving a very wide field of vision. From here, about twenty feet off the ground, you can see the village very well, as well as the white house behind the fence. The view of the sea is incredible; you can see further away, including the small island towards the southeast. You can climb back down the ladder.

Someone dropped a screwdriver here.

> jump
You would surely break your legs, or worse; you're not that desperate yet.
> x houses, storehouse, pump, fountain, fence, guard shack, community garden, pub, shop, woodshop, white house
Yep, you can see that part of the village too, from way up here.

> x screwdriver
This seems like a standard, slightly rusty flathead screwdriver; its head is rather small.
> take screwdriver
Taken.

> x horizon / island
To the southeast, on the horizon, is a small island. (if posterinpub hasn't seen) You had no idea there was another island nearby!(else) This is probably Tristam Island, that you saw on the map inside the pub. (end) The island is shaped a bit like a horseshoe, with a circular lagoon near its western shore. You can pretty much see the whole island from here, and something looks... off. You can't quite tell what, though; it is difficult to make out the details with the naked eye only.

> look through binoculars / look at island/landmass through binoculars
You take a look at the island through your binoculars, and your intuition was right. {Tristam|The} island looks rather inhospitable, covered in rocks and rubble, with patchy vegetation that doesn't look more than two feet tall. But near the shore, and on the sand in the lagoon, you spot a few long black trunks, as if the trees had been destroyed, charred, a long time ago, and hadn't manage to grow back since. Something must have happened on that island, but you can't quite figure out why. Your intuition tells you it's important, though.

> x hinges (c'est un rappel)
This door looks rather unique, as if it had been hacked together using only the resources of the island; the other doors look like standard doors that must have been made in a factory and imported here. Interestingly, the hinges are positioned on the exterior of the house here.
> take / remove hinges
The hinges are small, and you can't quite get at the pin with your fingers; you might need some kind of flat tool for this job.

> unscrew hinges / remove hinges with screwdriver / take door down with screwdriver / remove door with flathead screwdriver / wedge/insert screwdriver under pin/hinges / remove|lift pin out of hinge
After a few tries, you manage to wedge the screwdriver between the pin and the top hinge; after that, it's only a matter of lifting the pin out. You do the same for the two other hinges; the door then wobbles free. You catch it before it falls to the floor, then prop it up against the side of the house.
> x hinges / x door
You succeeded in taking the pin out of the hinges; the door is now out of the way, against the wall.
> open/unlock/lock/close door
Since the door is out of the way, you don't need to do this anymore.

Inside a house
This is a small house, with only the bare necessities: a bed, a small nighttable, a few chairs, and a bathroom. Life here was decidedly rather Spartan. There is a book on the nighttable.

You can also see a shilling on the floor.

> take shilling
Taken.

> sleep
It's still a bit early in the day to sleep.
> x bed / x chairs / x bathroom / x furniture
There really isn't much here for furniture; you're guessing life here was pretty regimented, and that food was only cooked and eaten at {some sort of cafeteria|the pub}.

A lovely wooden nighttable. {There is a book on it.}

(if library no)It's the only book you've seen so far on the island; you hope there is more, or you'll be reading this one for years...(else)The only other place where you've seen books on this island is the library in the white house. Perhaps it came from there?(end) Judging by the cover, this looks like a science-fiction book. The title is ~Kensington Gardens~, by Brian Moriarty. Never heard of it.

> read/search book
You flip through the book; it seems to be about nuclear apocalypse, and one person's quest to prevent it. At the very last page, four digits are written: 5-2-1-8. You wonder what these are for.

> x keypad / x screw
This is a rather primitive keypad, with buttons arranged in two rows and displaying all numbers from 0 to 10, and an extra button to clear the code. The metal plate has rusted over the years, and so did one of the screws holding the plate. You're guessing that, like all keypads, it requires electricity to work and open the door remotely.

> unscrew screw (with screwdriver) / unscrew keypad (with screwdriver) / open keypad (with screwdriver) / unlock keypad (with screwdriver)
This is a flathead screwdriver, and the screw is cruciform, but you give it a go anyway. It ends up working rather well, as the screwdriver is small enough to fit in the screw and turn it without stripping it too much. You manage to remove the front plate; a bunch of wires and connections appear behind it.

> x wires / x keypad
You follow the wires under the buttons to try to see where they go. There's a few pieces in the circuit you're not sure about; one of them is connected to the wires for the numbers, 1, 2, 5 and 8, while the other wires end up somewhere else, deeper in the circuit.

> touch wires
(if electricity is on)You know better than touching wires when the electricity is on.(else)You know there isn't any electricity on this island, but still, you'd rather not touch these.(end)

> screw screw / screw keypad (back) (with screwdriver) / close keypad  (with screwdriver) / lock keypad (with screwdriver)
You put the plate back on the keypad and screw the screws holding it while you repeat the numbers to yourself so as not to forget them.

> type 5218 on keypad


As soon as you pushed the last number, a door can be heard from the door. You hurry and grab the handle, and the door swings open. You enter the white mansion.


As soon as you pushed the last number, a door can be heard from the door. You hurry and grab the handle, and the door swings open.

At last, you enter the white mansion. The tall, white mansion, inside of which there is something so important that it needed to be protected by a fence, a guard, and a keypad. There were two kinds of people on this island: the ones in the village, who fished and canned and mended and kept the island running, and weren't allowed to enter the fence; and the people who were, who knew the combination on the keypad, and who stayed there. You feel like the whole purpose of the island was whatever was going on in this white house; and now, finally, you are able to enter it, and discover its secrets. This has intrigued you so much, at this point it's not just about finding a working radio anymore; it's also about finding out what the purpose of the island was, and why everyone left.


























! Mansion

Lobby of the white house
The entrance of the white house is a large and rather messy atrium. It is a bit dark in here, since all the windows here have been boarded up, but a few lights are turned on. The walls are covered in all sorts of notices and placard, some official-looking, some less so. A lone U-shaped pipe is hanging from the wall, as well as a rope-and-pulley mechanism to which are attached two buckets. High up next to the pulley, a weight rests on a platform; the rope it's attached to goes inside a hole in the north wall. A tall statue stands in the middle of the room, in front of a wooden staircase leading up; next to the stairs, leading east, is a wide passageway. A hallway leads to the library, south of here; there is a closed door on the north wall, next to an odd tube-like contraption screwed onto a tilted stand.

>x light / windows / openings / outside / switch (found_in: if location ofclass InsideMansion & Lab)
(if mansion) The windows here are all boarded up; barely any sunlight is shining through, and what you see is mostly thanks to the lights in the lobby.
(if lab) This complex is underground, deep inside the island, so there isn't any natural light here; only the pale glow of the neons.
>turn off lights
You don't know where the switch would be. Besides, you appreciate having the light on.

>x contraption
Which do you mean, the tube-like contraption or the giant contraption?

>giant
>x machine / rube goldberg machine / heath robinson contraption
It all looks purposeful, but it's absolutely mystifying. {The rope-and-pulley mechanism doesn't look like it does anything but make the buckets go up and down.} {The U-shaped pipe is made of several segments; one of its extremities is angled up, and the opening is wider, like a funnel. It is hanging horizontally from the ceiling, above the stairs}. The weight is precariously resting on a platform that's too small for it{; should it fall, it would probably pull on the rope that runs inside a pulley and towards a hole up high in the north wall.} Simply baffling.

>x rope / x pulley / x mechanism / bucket(s)
{The rope-and-pulley mechanism doesn't look like it does anything but make the buckets go up and down.} The bucket on the left looks like it's under the platform supporting the weight. The bucket on the left is currently down, while the bucket on the right is up, out of reach.

>x platform / x weight / x weight on platform / x l-pieces/brackets/angled metal/steel screwed thin
The platform supporting the weight is nothing but a couple of thin metal L-shaped brackets screwed in the wall. It looks like it wouldn't take much to knock the weight out of balance{; should it fall, it would probably pull on the rope that runs inside a hole up high in the north wall.}

>x u-shaped pipe / funnel / horizontal / angled / extremities / opening
{The U-shaped pipe is made of several segments; one of its extremities is angled up, and the opening is wider, like a funnel. It is hanging horizontally from the ceiling, above the stairs}; you might be able to reach it from the top of the stairs.

> x tube-like contraption / stand / valve / handle / cannon / opening / bike / cannon
(first)This is odd.(end) This is a rather wide tube, screwed on tight onto a tilted stand. The lower extremity is closed, and some sort of valve is attached to it. The other end is open; the diameter is big enough you could put your fist in there. In the middle, the tube shrinks, and a tap has been placed here. (first)You scratch your head and think for a moment. A tilted tube open on one side, with a tap that presumably opens or seals the space between both extremities... It looks like some kind of air cannon, maybe?(else)This looks like some kind of air cannon that was hacked together out of spare parts - for what purpose, though?(end)

> x statue
(TODO: Infocom reference?? y'a une statue de peter pan dans trinity. Oui mais ça fait pas beaucoup de Trinity? Bah, on se rapproche de la fin quand même.)
The chalk statue on top of the cylindrical base is that of a little boy wearing a tunic, in a dynamic position, blowing in a sort of pipe or small flute. You've seen this sculpture before, though you can't remember where. Is this child the pied piper? Peter Pan? Anyway, it's actually not a bad sculpture; it is rather aesthetically pleasing, even though some details look a bit crude. Your best guess is that someone with an artistic inclination cut a slab of the cliffs and worked from a model, to pass time perhaps. The statue looks a bit off-kilter; the child is looking towards the northern door instead of towards the entrance, where you would expect it to look.

> x stairs / mezzanine / wood/wooden banister/balustrade/railing/handrail/barrier
A wide staircase in the lobby leads up to a mezzanine and a hallway. The mezzanine is rather wide, and has wooden banisters around it.
> x hallway : you decide to go check it out

> x placards / posters / notices / announcements / drawings / graffitis / board / cork / walls
On both sides of the hall, posters, placards and notices are taped to the wall or pinned to notice boards. You read one of them at random, and it says:
(the first one is always:)     - "A reminder for everyone: I approved that ridiculous Heath Robinson mechanism to open the door to the laboratory to keep morale up while preserving secure access to it. I could very well replace it with a keypad. Do NOT waste more time making it more complex, and get on with your work. --Major Westwood."
                        [your score has gone up by one point)
    - "WARNING: we remind you that any civilians behind the fence are not allowed in here. Details of the project, such as schematics or scientific reports, are extremely valuable to the Crown -- and to its enemies. Do not give out the keypad code, and do not write it anywhere, out of precaution."
    - "NOTE: the shortages that have plagued us lately will be no more with the arrival of another boat in the next couple of weeks. In the meantime, I expect you strong British boys to put on a brave face. --Major Westwood."
    - "WARNING: due to the unfortunate incident that happened on the 9th of January, I'm installing a curfew at 10pm for two weeks. Anyone who is still at the pub at that time will be found and disciplined. --Major Westwood."
    - ~Who currently has ~Kensington Gardens~, by Brian Moriarty? I was going to re-read it but I didn't find it in the library. --Steve~
    - ~Mr Chad says: ~Wot, no sugar?~~, with a drawing of a bald man with a large nose poking out of a wall.
    - ... well, some kind of mathematic formula. An... integral sign? E to the x ? Equals f(un). You don't get it.
    - "Help! I'm trapped on a secret island, kept by the British military to work on a deadly project!"
    - "Tristam Island. Come enjoy its natural beauty, its peace and quiet, its crater, its absolute man-made desolation."
    - "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."
    - "Petition to remove all the love songs from the pub's jukebox. All they do is make us more lonesome.", with six different marks next to it.

You were expecting that wonderful smell of paper, but instead it smells rather musty. {Half a dozen shelves are packed with books of all shapes and sizes.

This is a rather small cafeteria, with {four tables in total, and wooden benches on each side of the tables. The tables are long and wide, but you're guessing that no more than 20 people would fit here.} The whole room feels deserted and only slightly lit. The door to the kitchen is closed.

You lean on the railing, and you can see the whole lobby, with the statue in the middle of the room, the hallway to the library, and the closed door to the north. The ropes, the weight, and the buckets are all out of reach, but the U-shaped pipe is right above your head. A hallway leads further to the east.

The U-shaped pipe is hanging right above your head; you could easily touch it by climing the mezzanine. The funnel is closer to the south wall, while the other side of the pipe runs over your head and stops right before the buckets.

This is a rather short hallway, lit by a single light bulb, with four different doors. The furthest one, at the very back, is a door saying ~OFFICERS ONLY~.

As soon as you do this, the bucket
(if ball notin bucket) goes up; the system of buckets ends up stabilizing with both buckets roughly at the same height.
(if ball in bucket) flies upwards very fast. The edge of the bucket hits the weight.^^The weight, which wasn't very stable on such a small platform, is out of balance and falls towards the ground. The rope tenses up before the weight hits the ground; the weight is now in mid-air.

Antechamber
This small room seems to have for only purpose to serve as a waiting room (initial)before entering the next door, which is made of glass. There is a button on the door frame. Right -- an elevator!^^You step away from the door to the lobby, as a large weight is hanging from the ceiling right above it; this was probably the weight that was keeping the door shut.(else) for the elevator. At this point, there is only one sensible thing to do...

> x mirror / elevator / door
> x button
<Look>

> push button / go down / close door
You push the button with some trepidation; the doors close, and the elevator starts its descent.^^You turn and turn the facts in your head, trying to figure out what this place is. An elevator going deep underground. A mansion with a floor for civilians, maybe even scientists, but under military supervision, and another floor for officers. A door with an overly complicated mechanism, with one part moving another in a big chain reaction. A library full of science-fiction books, and barely anything else.^^The elevator is still going deeper.^^Who were the civilians living here, under military supervision, but clearly not jailed? Were they working for the military? On what kind of project? This is getting a bit spooky.^^The elevator finally stops. After what seems like an eternity, it opens, revealing a long hallway lit only by artificial light. At this precise moment, it all comes together, and you understand everything. The shock makes you unable to move for a few minutes, as all the pieces come together perfectly in your head. You know the secret of this island.

Lobby
You stepped out of the elevator, north of you. This looks like an underground complex, with a long hallway, dimly lit by pale neons fixed to a false ceiling, and various rooms to explore, none of which have doors. Well, except one: to the west, you can see a door, with a plaque that reads ~COMMS ROOM~ -- at last, a way to use the radio and send an SOS message! There is a small desk here, facing the elevator; above the desk is a poster of the explosion of an atom bomb.

(daemon: you drop the box, to give your arms a rest ; you switch the weight of the box around, because your arms are hurting ; your arms feel like they're burning)

This is it. The smoking gun. The missing part of the puzzle, that makes everything else makes sense. The people on this island were working on nuclear testing. (if TRISTAM_LOOKED_CLOSELY)That explains the poor state Tristam Island is in: it was their Guinea pig, where they detonated the bomb, so they could destroy it and study the effects of the explosion.(else)(if WE_SAW_TRISTAM)If they did set off a nuclear bomb, it was probably on the neighbouring island, which they could then study.

Lab
This is a rather dark lab, lit only by the neon in the hallway; you can't locate a light switch, but there is enough light to see. There is a wide workbench here, with a small sink and a few empty beakers. There are more beakers on the shelves, as well as a small device with a dial. You can go back to the hallway by going north, or go east to explore another part of the lab connected to this one.

Lab
This looks like an area where some serious thinking was happening. A few comfortable-looking chairs and a sofa are all facing a blackboard, which is covered is symbols and esoteric drawings; not too far from the blackboard, a coffee maker is resting on a filing cabinet. There are only two books left on the shelves, a rather thick one and an absolutely massive one. You can go to the hallway by going north, or west to another part of the lab connected to this room.

    Major,
    I urgently request that you and your superiors reconsider the test scheduled for the 15th of February 1962. Our estimates for the type of bomb we are working with, and its size, are several hundred kilotons above what we would consider safe considering the distance between our island and Tristam Island.
    We are not so much worried about the damage the bomb would cause to our island and its structures, but more so about the radioactive fallout that has a high chance of blowing our way. Should this happen, the radiation exposure of our island would be high, and remain high as the ashes deposit on our island. Remaining on the island would not be an option; we calculated with our resident doctor that the risk of cancer of the residents would increase one hundredfold.
    Please, we urge you to reconsider the size of the blast, if you want our experimentations here to continue; a blast this size would render our island unlivable, and would require us to evacuate it.
    Sincerely,
    Doctor Alexander Grant
    
Wow. Is this what happened on this island? Is this why everyone left? Did they go ahead with the explosion, and it exposed everybody to so much radiation that the island was inhospitable? Given the state of the village, (flag)the date on the comic book, (flag)the songs in the jukebox, (flag) the fact people stopped signing up to take care of the garden after the 18th of February, it would make sense to guess that this island was indeed abandoned in February 1962...

Either way, you hadn't considered how the fallout might affect this island -- and with it, you. You ate a fish that probably was pretty close to Tristam Island, (flag) drank the water from the fountain, touched a lot of objects... You need to {if not found}find the key to the communications room, and }quickly get out of this island.

Hallway by a window
In this part of the hallway, there is a large window, which goes almost all the way to the false ceiling; the window overlooks (flag) something you can't quite see. A neon is blinking to the north, near a door at the end of the hallway. You can see some lockers to the south.

> look through window
(flag activated)
You look through the window, and see a wide open space. Your eyes habituate to the darkness, and you see shimmering water, and what looks like a very large loading dock. There doesn't seem to be a way to enter or exit this sort of grotto, which explains why you didn't see it from the beach. But there still is a loading dock, suggesting some kind of boat, maybe a submarine, was moored here... On the loading dock is a large crate. You have no idea what is in it.

You look up. The space looks quite tight, but your fingers can reach the metal supports of the suspended ceiling. You should be able to do it...

You take a deep breath, and jump! Then using all your strength, you pull yourself up to the roof, grabbing the ceiling's supports with the tip of your fingers. Your arms are burning, your fingers hurt, and you are momentarily exhausted, but you made it!

You crawl a few feet in the space above the false ceiling, then remove one of the tiles: you are indeed above the Major's office! You crawl into the opening, then drop down awkwardly.

You call for help repeatedly on the frequency <freq>, but you get no response; noting but static. You're about to take the headphones off, when...
~Namibian Coast Guards here. SOS, can you hear me?~

You frantically push the button, and establish contact with them -- the first people you have talked to in a long while, and your lifeline here. After a few hours, they are able to confirm your position, and tell you to stand by.

It takes a few more days, but when you see the helicopter approaching, you yelp in delight. The helicopter lands on the field in front of the white house, and a British officer gets off the helicopter. ~How do you do. My name is Colonel Bradley, and I'm here to take you home. Are you ready?~

And as the helicopter gains altitude, you look back down at Tristam Island. The small island is soon nothing more than a speck in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean; but you're taking its secret home with you.
