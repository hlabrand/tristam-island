TRISTAM ISLAND
By Hugo Labrande

Manual for : CP/M version

=================================

After crashing your plane at sea, you end up drifting to a small island, with not much to survive. You explore, and find out the island was inhabited, years ago. But why did the people leave? And why is there a fence around that big building at the top of the hill?

=================================

HOW TO PLAY

There is no specific CP/M release for this game, as the CP/M interpreter is Infocom's (and thus presumably still under Activision's copyright). However, here are a few indications on how to run "Tristam Island" using CP/M.

This covers computers such as the Osborne I (which had specific official Infocom releases, such as "Zork" or "Starcross"; the same can be said of the DEC Rainbow and the Kaypro II), the Intertec Superbrain (which did not have official Infocom releases, and requires patching the interpreter), or the PC-88 (which saw a release of "Zork 1, 2, 3" by Infocom, which bundled a PC-88 port of CP/M on the same disk).

- The first step is to acquire the CP/M interpreter;
- If your computer had a specific official Infocom release, grab the interpreter from that release and skip to step 4;
- If not, use the interpreter from a CP/M release and adapt the interpreter to your machine (via patching the code) to resolve any display issues. There are various sources for the procedure; a recent example of such patching is detailed in the following blog post by Richard Oxley : https://www.richardloxley.com/2018/04/28/osborne-restoration-part-17-text-adventure-games/.
- Get the story file (*.z3 or *.DAT) for "Tristam Island" from your physical release or on itch.io (hlabrande.itch.io/tristam-island);
- Put it on the same floppy as the interpreter file, renaming it "XXX.DAT", where XXX is the name of the interpreter file.
- The game now (hopefully) runs.

Example of inputs recognized by the game are: go east, examine sky, inventory, enter ocean, take pebble, open matchbook. Around 100 verbs are recognized by the game.

There are no built-in hints in the game (there just isn't the space!), so I encourage you to ask other players for help!

If you encounter a bug, or if a sensible command wasn't recognized, or if you want to give me any sort of feedback, don't hesitate to send me an email : hugo at hlabrande dot fr.
