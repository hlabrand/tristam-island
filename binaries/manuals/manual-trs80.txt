TRISTAM ISLAND
By Hugo Labrande

Manual for : TRS-80 Model III version

=================================

After crashing your plane at sea, you end up drifting to a small island, with not much to survive. You explore, and find out the island was inhabited, years ago. But why did the people leave? And why is there a fence around that big building at the top of the hill?

=================================

HOW TO PLAY

There is no specific TRS-80 Model III release for this game. The reason is simple: the only TRS-80 Model III Z-Machine interpreter there is is Infocom's (and thus presumably still under Activision's copyright), and that interpreter was discontinued in 1984 (meaning use at your own risks - it has never been tested on a game that's more than 110kb).

Should you still wish to try it, here is a step-by-step walkthrough:
- Acquire an Infocom release for the TRS-80 Model III; the disk should have two files, a /cmd and a /dat;
- Get the story file (*.z3 or *.DAT) for "Tristam Island" from your physical release or on itch.io (hlabrande.itch.io/tristam-island);
- Create a (possibly virtual) blank disk, and copy the /cmd file, renaming it "tristam/cmd";
- Copy the story file onto the disk, renaming it "tristam/dat";
- Boot the TRS-80 into DOS with the new disk as a second drive;
- You can then run the game by typing "TRISTAM".

Example of inputs recognized by the game are: go east, examine sky, inventory, enter ocean, take pebble, open matchbook. Around 100 verbs are recognized by the game.

There are no built-in hints in the game (there just isn't the space!), so I encourage you to ask other players for help!

If you encounter a bug, or if a sensible command wasn't recognized, or if you want to give me any sort of feedback, don't hesitate to send me an email : hugo at hlabrande dot fr.
