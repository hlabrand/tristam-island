TRISTAM ISLAND
By Hugo Labrande

Manual for : Amstrad CPC version

=================================

After crashing your plane at sea, you end up drifting to a small island, with not much to survive. You explore, and find out the island was inhabited, years ago. But why did the people leave? And why is there a fence around that big building at the top of the hill?

=================================

HOW TO PLAY

- Insert the disk in your Amstrad CPC (or your emulator).
- Start the system.
- Type RUN"DISC.
- The game then starts.

Example of inputs recognized by the game are: go east, examine sky, inventory, enter ocean, take pebble, open matchbook. Around 100 verbs are recognized by the game.

There are no built-in hints in the game (there just isn't the space!), so I encourage you to ask other players for help!

If you encounter a bug, or if a sensible command wasn't recognized, or if you want to give me any sort of feedback, don't hesitate to send me an email : hugo at hlabrande dot fr.
