TRISTAM ISLAND
By Hugo Labrande

Manual for : Linux version

=================================

After crashing your plane at sea, you end up drifting to a small island, with not much to survive. You explore, and find out the island was inhabited, years ago. But why did the people leave? And why is there a fence around that big building at the top of the hill?

=================================

HOW TO PLAY

- Decompress the zip file and go in the "lectrote" folder (lectrote-linux-ia32 if you use 32-bit Linux, lectrote-linux-x64 if you use 64-bit Linux).
- Start "Lectrote".
- Click on "Open game" and select the "tristam.zblorb" file.
- The game then starts.

If you want to look at the game's official cover art, select "View" in the toolbar, then "View cover art".

Example of inputs recognized by the game are: go east, examine sky, inventory, enter ocean, take pebble, open matchbook. Around 100 verbs are recognized by the game.

There are no built-in hints in the game (there just isn't the space!), so I encourage you to ask other players for help!

If you encounter a bug, or if a sensible command wasn't recognized, or if you want to give me any sort of feedback, don't hesitate to send me an email : hugo at hlabrande dot fr.
